## Planned Features

  * Save and graph all session data for race analysis
  * Configurable channel groups and data normalisation
  * Export session data to CSV for sharing/import 

## Usage

Ensure F1 2019 Telemetry is enabled, not in Broadcast mode, and the port is set to '20777'. This will be configurable in the future. 

Once a session begins, data will automatically be streamed to the program, enable the checkbox for the desired data sources.

üÖ±Ô∏èono works best with a 60Hz update rate.
